<h2 id="the-problem-with-resolutions">The Problem with Resolutions</h2>

<p>I love New Years Eve. It&rsquo;s my favorite of all holidays! Other holidays celebrate bunnies, or monsters, or the systemic exploitation of indigenous people, or Jesus Christ&rsquo;s kind-of birthday<sup><a href="#FN1">[1]</a></sup>, but not New Years. New Years celebrates reflection on the past and hope for the future.</p>

<p>In the spirit of the New Year, I take a couple hours a day out of my holiday vacation time to retrospect on the past year, plan for the upcoming year, and set goals. Since I place a lot of stock in the power of momentous occasions, I take this process seriously. My year-in retrospective usually ends up looking like a formal project retro would at work, my resolutions end up encompassing pages of categorized goals, and I end up with fairly organized plans detailing how I will get from where I am at the end of this year to where my ideal self is at the end of next year.</p>

<p><strong>In short, I, like many people, write a set of New Years Resolutions. I also, like many people, tend to fall short on my resolutions by a wide margin.</strong></p>

<p>My failure to stick to my resolutions became particularly apparent this year. I realized there were quite a few 2018 resolutions that I was recycling into 2019 resolutions<sup><a href="#FN2">[2]</a></sup>. Looking back further, I found that this was a pattern that had emerged over the last few years; there were resolutions I set four years ago which I had resolved to work on but never even started to actualize.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>A large part of this year&rsquo;s retro involved getting to the bottom of this phenomenon, and thanks to Tim Ferriss, I have a working theory and a plan forward.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Chef-Cooking-Learning-Anything/dp/1328519163/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1546482761&amp;sr=8-2">The 4-Hour Chef</a>, Tim Ferriss breaks down his personal method for becoming excellent at a skill in the shortest possible period of time. Whether it&rsquo;s learning a language in a week or preparing to compete in the world championships for Argentinian Tango in a month, Tim&rsquo;s thesis is that the core tenants and principles of learning are the same.</p>

<p>Tim&rsquo;s entire systems approach to skill acquisition was informative and well-designed, one observation in particular struck a chord with me. Specifically, he noticed that <strong>the most important aspect of improvement often isn&rsquo;t adding something new, but rather taking something away</strong>.</p>

<p>With respect to writing The 4-Hour Chef, that meant choosing recipes that required no more than 4 main ingredients. With respect to New Years Resolutions, this means focusing not just on what I <em>am</em> going to do in 2019, but also what I&rsquo;m going to <em>not</em> do.</p>

<p>All too often I start the new year with a list of 20 some odd new things I&rsquo;m adding to my life:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to write more</li>
<li>I want to habitualize the ideal morning routine</li>
<li>I want to meditate after work</li>
<li>I want to spend time on independent professional development outside of working hours and <em>finally</em> figure out how the hell kubernetes <em>actually</em> works<sup><a href="#FN3">[3]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>The problem is that time, energy, and resolve are not infinite.</strong>
When you decide to add TODOs to your day, your year, or your life, you&rsquo;re implicitly also deciding to either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do more things than you were doing before, or</li>
<li>Remove some of the things you were doing before in order to do these new things instead.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
Sure enough, when my resolutions don&rsquo;t include the active, intentional removal of things from my life, they just add more to my plate. I may make it through a few months of just doing more, but within a month or two, I&rsquo;m exhausted and my goals fall by the wayside. And just like that, all of the momentum that I was so excited to capitalize on is gone.</p>

<p>So this year, before writing my resolutions, I took a look at what takes up space in my life. I asked myself how I spend my time and how much of my time is actually serving me. Once I identified the parts of my life that were absorbing time and energy but providing little in return<sup><a href="#FN4">[4]</a></sup>, I resolved to cut out the bad before trying to introduce the good.</p>

<p>In other words, contrary to Michael Scott&rsquo;s assertion above, I believe that a good way forward may be Addition by Subtraction. That&rsquo;s why my focus heading into 2019 is on removing the bad to create space for the good.</p>

<p>Happy new year, and cheers to an amazing 2019!</p>
